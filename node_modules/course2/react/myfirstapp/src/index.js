//of the application into the DOM. This is typically done using ReactDOM.render() or, in more recent versions of React,
//ReactDOM.createRoot().render(). The root component is the top-level component of your React application, and it serves as the entry
//point for rendering the rest of the application's components.

setInterval(ref, 1000); //It calls setInterval(ref, 1000) to repeatedly call the ref function every second, effectively updating the UI with the current time.
